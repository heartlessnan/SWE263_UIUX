            <p>
              During a trip, a group of people often have the need of splitting
              bills with others. Our project’s current problem is: How can we
              split bills effectively and accurately, and how can we make our
              application track user’s every payment in detail to help them
              better control their total expense?
              Our group is going to design a spilt bill application, BuckFly.
              The main function of BuckFly is helping people calculate bills automatically,
              giving itemized information and the amount each person needs to pay or receive.

              Each member of our team conducted three one-on-one interviews and
              finished nine interviews in total. Each interview took around 30
              minutes to complete. Our primary goal from these interviews was to
              understand whether our participants have the need of bill splitting
              with others, the problem they met during the bill splitting and whether
              they used any software or application to help them with their bill.
              Once we had finished our interviews, we had several team meetings to
              assemble an affinity diagram and analyze our findings. We highlighted
              important information from each interview and found three insights.

              <br />
              People who are under 40 with active bill-splitting needs usually
              use digital note-keeping tools to maintain bill records. But they
              usually feel it tedious if it takes them more than 30 seconds to
              create a new transaction every time, let alone a lot of typing work
              required. The interviewees we have constantly mentioned they wish there
              is a way to note bills quickly and without taking too much effort.

              <br />
              It is terrible to manage all bills for one person who was elected and
              responsible to record and calculate expenses for the group. The elected
              person might make mistakes or omissions that cause other people’s concerns.
              Therefore, if everyone in the group can participate in the process of
              recording and calculating the expenses, everyone is not required to do much
              and can spread the responsibility evenly among everyone.

              </strong>
              <br />
              People who pay bills for a group often want reminders in some way
              to remind the group when some group members fail to pay the bill in
              a certain period of time. So that the people who pay the bills in
              advance could get their money back in time.

              We created a Storyboard that a group of people go out to travel.
              One of the group members choose the rental car for the group, and
              used his own credit card to pay the rental fee for the whole group.
              He is really unhappy when spending this large amount of money and
              other group members haven't paid him back.

              We first brainstormed to simulate different workflows based on the insights and user stories we concluded previously. 
              Then discussed the wireframes we needed and create the prototype on Figma.
              After that, we applied Nielsen’s 10 Heuristics rules to analyze our prototype, which allowed us to discover and evaluate potential usability issues.

            <p>
              In our design, every bill is associated with a specific group.
              More specifically, red means you owe others money and green means the opposite. 
              And Blue means the other status or a settleup among a group.
              To let users view the status more efficiently,
              we used high-fidelity colors(Red, Green Blue) to denote different status of the entity.  
              In our prototype, we have the following features:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Register a new account; sign in via email and password or a existing third-party account.
              </li>
              <li>
                Group page. View the groups users have; create or join a group.
              </li>
              <li>
                Transaction page. View the transactions of current group. Create or settleup transactions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Bill history page. View all transactions based on the timeline.
              </li>
              <li>
                Notification page. View all pay requests and auto-reminders based on the timeline.
              </li>
              <li>
                Setting page. Profile editing; view usage policies; log out.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <div class="heading"><h2>Evaluations</h2></div>
            <p>
              At this stage, we individually study the idea of

                >Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design</a
              >
              . Then we walked through the features above with the rules and sought usability issues for the prototype.
              We tried to evaluate them using the scale from 0 to 5 and found the most important usability issues.
              Here is the result chart.

          As a team, we worked well together for every milestone and design
          process. We took advantages of teammate's idea during researches and
          read other teammate's report to help us perform better in the next
          step. We encouraged each other when met difficulties such as narrowing
          down interview questions and consolidating insights. We are proud
          of our work and achievement in these 11 weeks. We are also grateful
          to Professor Matt and TAs who help us learn this much.

              Can Wang: I am very thankful to Professor Matt and TAs for helping
              me so much in this quarter. I also want to say I really appreciate my
              teammates, Ruokun and Xinnan. Ruokun is a great teammate. He always
              takes leads on the milestones and discussions of the assignments. He would
              make appointments with TA in advance for our group, allowing us to have
              enough time meeting and ask questions with TAs. Xinnan is an excellent
              teammate, who always comes up with great ideas and pushing us to finish
              the milestones as early as possible.

            <br />
            <p>
              Ruokun Xu: I am grateful to Professor Matt for his teaching this quarter.
              At the beginning of the course, I had some doubts about Prof.Matt's requirements because
              I feel individual creativity is limited by those requirements. But with Prof. Matt's guidance,
              I understood the meaning of the design requirements and logic that Prof.Matt
              wanted us to understand. Some things are not as naive as I thought. Prof.Matt
              taught me that a scientific design flow helps us blueprint superior user experiences.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Xinnan Wu: I really want to say thank you to Professor Matt, TA Ethan
              and Yang for the supports and guidance you gave to me and our team this
              quarter. I still remembered in the first lecture I did not what Figma
              is when other classmates were discussing this UX design tool. But after
              one quarter's lecture and projects, I am able to getting a peek of what
              UX designers are doing in the real world and the tools they use for design
              and analysis. Thank you for making the knowledge easy to understand and
              accessible to us.
